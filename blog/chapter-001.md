## Chapter 1 - Anything that helps any one of us, helps all of us

There are many ways for one person to motivate another.  Broadly, they fall along the lines of appealing to another's emotions.  For example, you could shame a person into doing something that you want them to do.  "What would your mother say, if she saw you refusing to help me out here?  Have you thought about that?"  Closely related, you could guilt someone into helping you.  "After ALL I've done for you, you won't do this one little thing for me?!?"  I venture to say that for every natural emotion that people have, it's possible to tap that emotion, recruiting the other's feelings to convince them to do what you want them to do.

So why not tap into a person's natural emotions of community, belonging, and mutuality?  This is the idea behind the phrase, "Anything that helps any one of us, helps all of us."  It frames what needs to be done as a shared responsibility, and as a shared benefit.  It calls upon the other's outward-facing frame of mind, to consider other's needs, in balance with their own needs.

This works in both direct and indirect ways.

Directly, we cannot avoid the fact that there are things to be done, but we can exercise a certain amount of control over the details, including who does them.  Anything that I do is one less thing that anyone else has to do; anything someone else does is one less thing that I have to do.  Further, when others have fewer things that they need to do, they have more latitude in choosing things they want to do, up to and including things we would also enjoy.  e.g., if the whole family works throughout the morning on household chores, we all have the whole afternoon, to spend with each other or to spend in our own, carefree way.  This applies to overall mood, as well; having that which needs to be taken care of actually taken care of brings with it satisfaction, optimism, and overall lightness.  In community, we affect and are affected by each others' moods, so it is wise to work toward each others' sense of accomplishment, and against anyone's feelings of exhaustion.

Indirectly, when we help another person, it is natural for them to be motivated to help us in turn.  This is not guaranteed, and there are dysfunctions that thwart this.  While we cannot control another's actions, we can live out the example we wish to see, and we can use our own actions as the basis for an open discussion about expectations of others.

Certainly it is *easier* to motivate people on the basis of other emotions.  Fear, shame, guilt, and such are strong emotions, and the energy they carry can easily be channeled to twist someone's arm behind their back.  But getting things done is only the surface-level goal.  There is a deeper, longer-term goal to build relationships and communities that are cooperative in general, and that are sincerely motivated by each others' needs.  It is counterproductive to genuine community for people to operate out of low self-worth, or out of fear of reprisal.

Love is another powerful emotion [1], and is an excellent basis for our own motivations.  But invoking love to motivate another too, too easily amounts to the opposite : some form of "If you loved me ...", which is a veiled request for proof, not love; or worse, such things sometimes are or become a threat to *withhold* love, which is absolutely love's opposite.  A relationship built on a spurious, capricious, or conditional love is not a relationship at all.

Love is definitely both the fabric and the foundation of community, and so is both the means and the end for the sincere, cooperative motivation I mentioned just above.  But as such, loving one another is **what we do** when we live in community with each other.  It is not a prize, it is not awarded, it is not earned.  Real love is not a status; it is a state, a way of being, a way of life.  We foster that way of life when we remember : anything that helps any one of us, helps all of us.
