# Pearls of Wisdom, with Dad

## Introduction

### origins

Like many parents, I have a great deal of advice for my children.  One opportunity for conveying this advice worked out to be short car rides -- to school, activities, etc.  When a thought struck, I would pretend to turn on the car radio ("Click!"), and intone in an old-time radio announcer's voice, "Time now for *Pearls of Wisdom, with Dad*, an occasional broadcast series, brought to you by our sponsors, the irrepressible instinct to pass along life's lessons to one's children".  (I might vary the sponsor ...)

Eventually, my daughter said to me, "Dad, you need to write these things down, because some of them are actually useful" (I'm paraphrasing).  Of course I procrastinated, but now she is heading to college in a few short months, and my opportunities for reaching over and "turning on the radio" for another episode of fatherly wisdom are fading.  Thus was born this blogsite.

### audience

Obviously, the original audience was one or both of my children.  The two of them continue to be my main audience, but I also open this up to people in general.  In truth, I cannot weigh the wisdom of my own words, but I strive to offer sound advice for living life.  I hope these thoughts serve you well, navigating life's waters, steering away from the rocks.
